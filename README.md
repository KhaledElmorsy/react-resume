This is a minimal resume web app built with React. 

 - It uses reusable and configurable components that are injected with base components and data model templates and render one or multiple ones according to their own logic. 
    - Check out the [List componenet](https://github.com/kelmorsy/react-resume/blob/main/src/List.js) to see that implementation.
 - The reasume state exists as one object in the App component to allow for potential editing/exporting APIs.
 - The state is saved to and loaded from local storage
